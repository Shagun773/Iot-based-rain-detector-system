# Iot-based-rain-detector-system
The IoT-Based Rain Detector System is a smart weather monitoring project that detects rainfall using a rain sensor and sends real-time data to an IoT platform like Blynk or ThingSpeak through a NodeMCU or Arduino. When rain is detected, the system can trigger alerts via buzzer, LED, or mobile notifications, allowing users to take timely action such as closing windows or stopping irrigation. This project is useful in smart homes, agriculture, and weather stations, providing an efficient, automated, and connected solution for monitoring rainfall.
